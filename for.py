# This is the basic syntax to write a for loop in Python

# for <loop_variable> in <iterable>:
#     <code>

# The iterable can be a list, tuple, dictionary, string, the sequence returned by range, a file, or any other type of iterable in Python

# We will start with range()


for i in range(5):
    print(i)


# Output
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
