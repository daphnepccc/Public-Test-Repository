# While loops are similar to for loops in that they let us repeat a block of code. The difference is that while loops run while a condition is True.

# In a while loop, we define the condition, not the number of iterations. The loop stops when the condition is False.

# This is the general syntax of a while loop:

# while <condition>:
#      <code>

x = 6
while x < 15:
print (x)
x += 1
